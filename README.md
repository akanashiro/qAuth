# qauth
A simple 2 steps verification Qt-based application using oathtool.

Dependencies:
- oathtool
- pyQT
- Sqlite

Very alpha stage but, what can do:
- Open a db stored from different locations (Ctrl+O).
- Add service
- Copy to clipboard selected "2FA token"
- Show/Hide OTP

In progress:
- Create a new db file (Ctrl+N).

In the future:
- Use PySide2 instead of pyQT
